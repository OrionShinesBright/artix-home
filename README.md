# $HOME

This is the artix linux setup for my $HOME. Nothing too special.

I guess you might feel a bit of a paradigm shift between this, and conventional 'dotfile repos'..
I don't exactly like them.. cuz.. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not the only kind of HOME we have on our system.
Feels weird to not cater to the actual `$HOME`.<br>

So, yeah.. this repo does that.
